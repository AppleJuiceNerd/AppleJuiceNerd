I don't have much to say about myself.

- I am actively working on a [CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter](https://github.com/AppleJuiceNerd/CHIPPIE) in my free time
- I am on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@AppleJuiceNerd) (although quite inactive)

Basic webpage coming soon maybe.

Have a good day :)
